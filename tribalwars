						"title": "PVP Engagement Rules",
						"text": "The rules of combat in Age of Dynasties RP are forever changing to ensure the best experience for our players. For now, they are as follows\r\n\r\n1a) No Killing on Sight, all instances of PvP outside the PvP Zone must be roleplayed accordingly. \r\n\r\n1b) If you wish to cause harm to another player you must do so within the context of roleplay. This means you must clearly announce your intent and give the other player time to respond accordingly. \r\n\r\nFor example \r\n\r\nHand me over that crossbow there or I'm gonna take it from ya \r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nDon't you know hunting in these lands comes at a cost? Now drop everything you have and get out of here\r\n\r\nThe other player must respond accordingly by either attempting to flee or clearly stating they are willing to fight\r\n\r\nOver my dead body\r\n \r\nOR\r\n\r\nYou'll regret saying that (slowly removes his blade from its scabbard)\r\n\r\nOnce it is clear that both sides wish to engage in combat the PvP may commence.\r\n\r\n2) Under no circumstances are you to disrupt another player while they are taming.\r\n\r\n3) Tranqs of any kind are not to be used in PvP with the exception of Narcotic Tripwire Traps. \r\n\r\n4) No killing or looting sleeping or offline players. It understandably may happen in war by accident but there are no other exceptions.\r\n\r\n5) Under no circumstances are you to attack another player's structures except in times of War and Siege.\r\n\r\n(More info on that can be found here insert link here)\r\n\r\n6) If you are found in someone's base uninvited they are allowed to kill you on sight. This death will not count toward your Roleplay death count. If after repeated offenses the kill is Roleplayed properly it may be discussed that it would be at Admin digression.\r\n\r\n7) When in war the attacking tribe is not to damage nor enter the passive barn/safehouse.\r\n.\r\n8) When in war the attacking tribe may not destroy any non-defensive structures (including perimeter walls). They are only to make an entry way large enough to allow their character access.\r\n\r\nThey are also not to destroy any storage or crafting stations.\r\n\r\n9) Surrendering Stops Combat. If either side chooses to surrender the other must cease combat immediately. The losing side must then in turn play things out accordingly. \r\n\r\n10) Hostages and Prisoners may be taken for up to 90 minutes in real life. \r\n\r\n11) Burglary at one's base is strictly off limits. \r\n\r\n12) No boxing in or \"turtling\" ones tames. Do not build structures around tamed creatures that are not your own.\r\n\r\n13) Longneck Rifles and Tranqs are not to be used in PvP\r\n\r\n14) When engaging in combat on open waters you are only to attack on foot or with cannons, ballista turrets or catapults. \r\n\r\n15) Wyverns, Dragons and Basilisks are not to be used in any form of PvP.  Wyverns and/or Dragons may be used upon in war if agreed upon by BOTH sides.\r\n\r\n16) Flyers may be used in PvP however the roleplay requirements still stand and absolutely NO PICKING (Grabbing another player or Dino)\r\nYou are only to use flying tames against other flying tames\r\n\r\nThere may be events where Wyvern and Flyer PvP will be allowed so don't hesitate to breed up those lines.\r\n\r\n17) Declaration of War must be approved by a member of the Admin Team. This is the only instance where you are able to attack one's home base without repercussions. \r\n\r\n18) War is not to be declared on any tribe at Village Tier or lower without roleplay. The attacking team must have tried to reason with or gain the fealty of these tribes before attempting to declare war.\r\n\r\nThere must be a clear and valid in world reason for this sort of Declaration of War \r\n\r\n19) Sieges are a different type of raid that only happen to a tribes outposts which can be built after reaching Kingdom. \r\n.\r\n20) Gigas, Carchas, Reapers and Brontos are not to be used in any form of PvP outside of War.

						"text": "We at Age of Dynasties RP are a community driven group that strive to make a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience for our players. \r\n\r\nWe are a crossplay server offering a medieval fantasy atmosphere where the lore is driven by the events taking place within the server. \r\n\r\nWe currently have two separate branches in operation; one centralized on the Medieval Guilds and Goblins mod and another with a more Classic Primitive ASA Roleplaying tone without premium mods. \r\n\r\nBoth servers operate similarly as far as rules and gameplay, with class systems in place for individuals and tiers in place for tribes. \r\n\r\nWe have capped the loot at a relatively low quality to try to encourage more communication and dependence on your fellow survivors. We intend to use various formats focused on roleplaying to inject the higher echelon items into play. Whether it be through guild quests, tier rewards or regularly scheduled events.\r\n\r\nWe are a little less boosted than regular roleplaying servers in hopes that we can recapture some nostalgia of the grind and fear we know this game can provide.\r\n\r\nWe plan to eventually expand to two maps on each cluster. \r\n\r\nThe Realm and the Underdark (Abberation) with the potential for further expansion down the line.
