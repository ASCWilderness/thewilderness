Everything must be agreed upon and done in a manner that does not disrupt other players.  \r\n\r\n- Tribes will be permitted to share their tames with each other and NO ONE ELSE.\r\n\r\n- It is important to know who you are tribing up with before doing so!\r\n\r\n- Tribes that are working together to form a shop must be in the same tribe on all maps. Every tribe member will take responsibility for pricing and maintaining the shop.  All members will also share responsibility in making sure all tames are spayed/neutered prior to sell if they are mutated, have high stats, or end of game tames. If any player breaks or violates a rule, all members of that tribe will be punished accordingly.\r\n\r\nAny tribe/groups that do decided to split or remove members must decide what tames belong to which members, if the player(s) leaving take the tame lines all others left must be spayed or neutered. Additionally if the tame lines say in the tribe/group any players leaving must then spay or neuter all tames, there is no more players taking tame lines with them!\r\n\r\nKNOW WHO YOU INVITE TO YOUR TRIBE/GROUP BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO TRIBE/GROUP UP!

You should eat them instead. Dropping the eggs prevents new ones from spawning.\r\n\r\n- Do not leave tames on wander or mating while you are offline. Tames found breaking this rule will be destroyed without notice."

Any traps violating this rule will be deleted on site.\r\n\r\n- Do not build in caves that have loot drops or artifacts, you cannot by any means block anything that other players need to access that will effect their gameplay. \r\n\r\n- Do not spam excessive decoration items when building; they can cause massive amounts of lag. Please try and limit them to the decoration of small gardens or just around your base."

Sell or trade them instead). Any players caught giving away high level mutated tames for free to extremely low cost will be subject to player and progress wipe immediately.\r\n\r\n- Any players trying to make private trade arrangements that violate the rules in any way are subject to player and progress wipe immediately.\r\n\r\n- No selling or trading items that will brake another players progression, helping them is one thing, but doing everything for them is prohibited."
