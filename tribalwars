You should eat them instead. Dropping the eggs prevents new ones from spawning.\r\n\r\n- If players would like to have a “Free” box for other players. They must also include a sign beside the box saying “Free” and can only have the following items within the box:\r\n\r\n Blueprints that are of Apprentice or lower quality, stone or low level tools of any tier, structures that are stone tier or lower, tames that are both low leveled and spayed, \r\nbasic Saddles, basic food/berries, arrows, cloth armor of any tier.\r\n\r\n- There is a limit of 1 teleporter per tribe.

Any traps violating this rule will be deleted on site.\r\n\r\n- Do not build in caves that have loot drops or artifacts, you cannot by any means block anything that other players need to access that will effect their gameplay. \r\n\r\n- Do not spam excessive decoration items when building; they can cause massive amounts of lag. Please try and limit them to the decoration of small gardens or just around your base.\r\n\r\n- Teleporter(s) must be properly named, unlocked, and made public if it isn't inside of your base."
